Social Engineering in Action

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.092
We define social engineering as the art of manipulating, influencing,

00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:10.195
and deceiving people for nefarious purposes.

00:00:10.196 --> 00:00:13.895
For example, during the height of the coronavirus pandemic,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.983
social engineers used a variety of well-crafted scams

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.912
 to convince people to divulge personal information

00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:23.096
or click on malicious links.

00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:26.147
One particularly effective email campaign

00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:30.059
involved the attackers masquerading as the World Health Organization,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.064
claiming to have highly important information regarding COVID-19.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:37.516
As you can probably guess, thousands of people clicked.

00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:42.068
Remember though: social engineers don’t limit their attacks to phishing.

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:45.320
 Their main objective is always to take advantage

00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:48.476
of the human tendency to trust specific people,

00:00:48.477 --> 00:00:52.191
and this can happen in many other places outside of email.

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:55.288
Imagine getting a phone call from someone in our IT department 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.208
claiming that our organization is running vital security updates. 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:03.551
They instruct you to go to a specific website and download something.

00:01:03.552 --> 00:01:04.832
Would you do it?

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.686
If you answered yes,

00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:10.096
how likely is it that you would infect your machine with malware? 

00:01:10.097 --> 00:01:13.297
In short, social engineers hack people 

00:01:13.298 --> 00:01:15.439
by leveraging human emotions. 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.479
Never give confidential information to anyone

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.340
over the phone, through email,

00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:23.088
on social media, or via text message

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:26.853
unless you can verify that they are legitimate and trustworthy. 

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:32.132
Follow your instincts, use common sense, and always think before you click. 

00:01:33.297 --> 00:01:35.357
Key Takeaways

00:01:35.358 --> 00:01:37.281
Social engineering is the art of

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:39.091
manipulating people, not computers. 

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:42.475
These attacks utilize a variety of mediums including

00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:45.059
email, text messages, and phone calls.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.481
Never reveal confidential information unless 

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:47.645
you can confirm the recipient is legitimate.
