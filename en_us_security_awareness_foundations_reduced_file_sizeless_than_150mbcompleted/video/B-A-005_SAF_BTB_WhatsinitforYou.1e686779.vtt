00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.902
What’s in It for You? 

00:00:01.903 --> 00:00:06.137
Before we begin, let’s clarify the purpose of this training.

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.863
It’s quite possible that you’re already familiar

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:10.879
with many of the topics we’ll cover.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.847
But because the cybersecurity landscape constantly changes,

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.727
we all need to refresh our knowledge periodically,

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:20.924
and continue to sharpen our security awareness skills.

00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:22.815
Throughout this training,

00:00:22.816 --> 00:00:25.911
you will gain insight into how cybercriminals think,

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:28.259
you will learn how security incidents occur

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.551
through the use of real-world examples,

00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:32.019
and upon completion,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.611
you will have a better understanding of your role

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:36.507
 in protecting the privacy of our

00:00:36.508 --> 00:00:40.851
employees, clients, customers, and business associates.

00:00:40.852 --> 00:00:43.667
Finally, we ask that you keep an open mind,

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.807
and to take advantage of this opportunity

00:00:45.808 --> 00:00:47.590
to fine-tune strategies that will 

00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:49.716
improve your overall security.
