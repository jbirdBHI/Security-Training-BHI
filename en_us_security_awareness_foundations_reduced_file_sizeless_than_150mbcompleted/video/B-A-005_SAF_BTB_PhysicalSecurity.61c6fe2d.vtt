Physical Security

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.367
If you found a USB flash drive,

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:06.191
 would you plug it into your computer?

00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:07.895
Many people would.

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:11.224
That’s why social engineers load flash drives with malware

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:13.443
and plant them in public areas.

00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:16.227
It’s an attack driven by curiosity.

00:00:16.228 --> 00:00:18.359
Physical security also includes 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.735
locking workstations when not in use,

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:24.223
shredding sensitive documents to prevent dumpster diving,

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.583
 ensuring that doors to secured areas remain locked,

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:31.567
not allowing anyone to piggyback off your badge or credentials, 

00:00:31.568 --> 00:00:33.800
and making sure no one slips in behind you 

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:36.178
when you enter secured areas.

00:00:36.192 --> 00:00:37.867
Like cybersecurity,

00:00:37.868 --> 00:00:40.799
physical security relies on you staying alert

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.852
and never making assumptions.

00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:46.720
Social engineers can and do exploit the physical domain

00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:48.483
just as they do the virtual.

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:50.983
Key Takeaways

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.963
Never plug in random USB flash drives or cables.

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:56.011
Lock your workstation when not in use. 

00:00:56.012 --> 00:00:59.867
Shred sensitive documents when they’re no longer needed.
