Incident Response

00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:03.975
When you notice a security incident, 

00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:06.219
which can be anything from a phishing attack

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.571
to finding a random USB device,

00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:10.464
you have a few choices:

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:11.807
do nothing at all, 

00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:14.463
report the incident when it’s convenient for you,

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:16.776
or report the incident immediately.

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:20.819
You should report the event immediately, every single time.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.192
Failure to report incidents prevents

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:25.528
our organization from investigating

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.305
and efficiently mitigating potential damages.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:32.199
Keep in mind that the longer the incident goes unreported,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.903
the more harm it can cause.

00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:37.000
Key Takeaways

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:38.843
Security incidents can be anything from

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:41.015
phishing attacks to random USB devices.

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:42.463
Report security incidents immediately.

00:00:42.464 --> 00:00:44.503
The longer an incident goes unreported,

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:45.903
the more damage it can cause.
