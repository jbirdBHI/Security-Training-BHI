00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:01.372
Clicks Happen

00:00:01.373 --> 00:00:03.256
Jasper’s example proves

00:00:03.257 --> 00:00:05.716
that people make mistakes and anyone,

00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:08.440
even the most cautious, security aware person,

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.856
could fall victim to a phishing attack. 

00:00:10.857 --> 00:00:12.927
You can prevent it from happening to you

00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:15.807
by slowing down and thinking critically.

00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:19.307
Treat all requests for sensitive information or money

00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:21.791
with a high degree of skepticism.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:24.283
Stay alert for common red flags such as

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:26.995
poor spelling and grammar, threatening language,

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:30.487
an urgent demand to click on a link or download an attachment,

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:33.643
and generic greetings like sir or madam. 

00:00:33.644 --> 00:00:37.855
Always hover over any links to reveal their full URL.

00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:40.255
And even if the URL appears legitimate,

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:43.584
don’t click unless you’re 100 percent sure it’s safe.

00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:46.523
Phishing ranks as the number one attack

00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:48.563
in a social engineer’s playbook.

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.451
Regardless of your job title,

00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:53.871
these attacks will eventually land in your inbox.

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:55.775
When you receive a phishing email, 

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:59.348
report it immediately by notifying the appropriate party.

00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:01.995
Key Takeaways

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:05.023
Treat requests for sensitive information with skepticism. 

00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:07.319
Stay alert for typical red flags like bad grammar

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.299
and urgent or threatening language. 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.558
Report all phishing attacks immediately.
