00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:01.280
Working from Home.

00:00:01.732 --> 00:00:04.651
The first thing to bear in mind when working from home

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:07.864
is that organizational policies still apply

00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.315
 and must be followed at all times.

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:13.655
It’s your responsibility to understand these policies

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:16.864
and create a workspace that prioritizes security. 

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:19.248
Here are a few tips to help you out:

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.948
Protect your router.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:22.711
If you haven’t already, 

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:26.643
update the username and password of your router immediately.

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:29.767
Most routers ship with default login credentials

00:00:29.768 --> 00:00:31.315
that are public knowledge.

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:34.580
If you need help, research your router’s model type, and

00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:37.773
you’ll find several how-to articles for router maintenance.

00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:40.108
Secure your WiFi.

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:43.851
Use a strong, unique password for your home WiFi.

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:47.851
This step is especially important if you live in an apartment complex,

00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:48.823
or similar,

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:52.515
where multiple people are close enough to access your network.

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:56.176
Never use the same password for your network and your router.

00:00:56.804 --> 00:00:58.900
Keep work and personal separate. 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.487
Avoid using work-issued devices for

00:01:01.488 --> 00:01:04.103
personal reasons and vice versa.

00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:06.899
Similarly, never use your work email

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.879
to conduct personal business. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.579
If you must use a single computer for both work and personal,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.975
set up separate user accounts to segregate data.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.404
Protect both with strong passwords.

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:20.904
Beware of roommates.

00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:24.320
By “roommates,” we mean your family, friends,

00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:26.471
or anyone else that lives with you.

00:01:26.472 --> 00:01:29.517
In short, never let other members of your household

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:33.645
 access work-related accounts, data, or devices.

00:01:34.984 --> 00:01:36.307
Key Takeaways

00:01:36.308 --> 00:01:38.319
Organizational policies must be followed at all times,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.991
even while working remotely.

00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:42.963
Keep work and personal accounts separate. 

00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:43.923
Don’t allow other members of your household 

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:44.645
to access work-related information.
