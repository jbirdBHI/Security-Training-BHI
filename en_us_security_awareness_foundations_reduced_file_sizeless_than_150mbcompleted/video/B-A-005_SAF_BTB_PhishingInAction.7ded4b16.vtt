Phishing in Action

00:00:02.496 --> 00:00:06.143
The end of the year is always immensely busy for Jasper. 

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:09.891
So busy, in fact, that he tends to rush through his minor tasks

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:12.932
and clean up his inbox as quickly as possible. 

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.647
Unfortunately, that hastiness led to a data breach.

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:19.711
While on a video call with several team members,

00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:24.159
 Jasper noticed an intriguing email from LinkedIn sitting in his inbox.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.555
He quickly opened it,

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:29.335
noting that the email looked like all the other LinkedIn notifications,

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:31.141
and clicked on a link that appeared to come

00:00:31.142 --> 00:00:33.290
from a potential client. 

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:35.551
When the link took him to a login screen,

00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:39.368
he let muscle memory take over and typed in his login. 

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:41.727
When this led him to a broken website,

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:44.031
he just assumed LinkedIn was down,

00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:46.520
closed the window, and got back to the call.

00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:48.251
A short time later, 

00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:50.086
the IT team discovered that his 

00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:52.781
corporate username and password had been stolen,

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:54.687
and that bad actors had managed to

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:57.295
gain access to the confidential information

00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:01.051
of all of the organization’s customers as a result.

00:01:01.052 --> 00:01:03.660
All it took was clever social engineering

00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:05.768
and an unaware, distracted click.

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:09.031
Key Takeaways

00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:11.003
Scammers craft emails that impersonate 

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.019
real websites or apps.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.039
Hasty clicks are dangerous clicks.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.375
Slow down and thoroughly inspect

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:18.895
emails before taking any action.
