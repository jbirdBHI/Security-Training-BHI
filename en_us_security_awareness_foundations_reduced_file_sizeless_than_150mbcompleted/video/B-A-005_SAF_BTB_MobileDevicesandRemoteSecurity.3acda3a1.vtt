Mobile Devices and Remote Security

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:05.791
Smartphones, tablets, and other devices

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:08.376
keep us connected no matter where we go.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.264
They also present significant security challenges

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:13.984
from both a professional and personal standpoint.

00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:17.856
Here are a few common threats and tips for how to avoid them: 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.520
Public WiFi 

00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:23.391
Public WiFi poses a major threat to privacy.

00:00:23.392 --> 00:00:27.935
You can mitigate that threat by using a virtual private network (VPN)

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:30.072
—software that encrypts your connection

00:00:30.073 --> 00:00:32.927
and prevents others from stealing your data.

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:34.660
But even with a VPN, 

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:38.580
it’s still best to avoid accessing highly sensitive information

00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:40.723
when connected to public networks.

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.203
Unpatched Vulnerabilities 

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.547
Out-of-date devices and software

00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:47.743
 leave doors open for cybercriminals

00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:49.678
who use known vulnerabilities

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.251
to install malware or steal data.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.369
Enable automatic updates wherever possible, 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.920
so you’ll never miss a critical security patch.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:00:59.971
Malicious Apps

00:01:00.237 --> 00:01:02.419
Scammers create malicious apps

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.641
—often impersonating legitimate apps—

00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:06.469
to invade privacy.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.727
 Before downloading or installing any software, 

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:13.292
research the developers and confirm they are legitimate. 

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:17.791
Once installed, carefully review the permissions and security settings

00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:21.184
to ensure the app isn’t collecting more data than necessary.

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:24.572
Always check our organization's current policies

00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:28.576
before installing any apps or software on work-issued devices.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.944
Public Charging Stations

00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:35.592
Many public places now offer free USB charging stations.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.836
Unfortunately, they represent yet another way for

00:01:38.837 --> 00:01:42.078
 cybercriminals to spread malware via an attack called

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.834
“juice jacking,” where they compromise your device

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:46.617
 via a USB connection.

00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:50.976
Only use the USB devices and chargers that belong to you.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.916
Smishing

00:01:53.336 --> 00:01:58.384
With messaging apps exploding in popularity, it’s no surprise that smishing 

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:02.380
—phishing via text message—attacks continue to rise. 

00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:03.673
Never click on links

00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:06.551
or respond to text messages from unknown users,

00:02:06.552 --> 00:02:09.888
 especially those who use threatening or urgent language.

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:13.024
Shoulder Surfing and Device Theft

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:15.957
Utilize situational awareness!

00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:18.869
When you’re in public areas or traveling,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.183
make sure no one can see your screen.

00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:23.075
Keep an eye on your belongings,

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:26.175
and never leave desirable items in plain sight.

00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:29.117
Use discretion when discussing or accessing

00:02:29.118 --> 00:02:31.679
 anything that might be deemed confidential.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.467
To avoid losing any devices or other important items,

00:02:35.468 --> 00:02:39.458
perform an inventory check before exiting public transportation, 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.614
checking out of hotels, and deboarding airplanes.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.066
Key Takeaways

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:50.066
Always use a virtual private network while connected to public WiFi.

00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:53.008
Stay alert for phishing attacks that target you via text message.

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.007
Keep devices and software up to date 

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.490
and allow automatic updates when possible.
